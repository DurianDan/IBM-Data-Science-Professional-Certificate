# What is [methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology/lecture/lMNmc/welcome)?
A **system of methods** used in a particular area of study or activity

## Methodology in Data Science
Aims to answer these **10 questions** in this prescribed sequence:
### - From Problem to approach
    1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve
    2. How can you use data to answer the question ?
### - Working with the data:
    3. What data do you need to answer the question ?
    4. Where is the data coming from (identify all sources) and how will you get it ?
    5. Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved ?
    6. What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data ? 
### - Deriving the answer:
    7. In what way can the data be visualizzed to get to the answer that is required ?
    8. Does the model used really answer the initial question  or does it need to be adjusted ?
    9. Can you put the model into practice ? 
    10. Can yout get constrive feedback into answering the question ?

# [CRISP-DM](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%201/CRISP-DM.md.html?origin=www.coursera.org) (Cross industry standard process for data mining)

- the CRISP_DM methodology is a process aimed at **increasing** the **use of data mining** over a wide variety of business applications and industries. 
- Main goal is to take case spectific scenerios and general behaviors -> **Domain Neutral**

## Steps
1. **Business Understanding**
    - Outlined the *questions.*
    - Require *communication and clarity*
    - stakeholders have different:
        - objectives
        - biases
        - relating information.
2. **Data Understanding**
    - From step 1 -> what data is *needed*
    - From which *source*
    - Collect data with what *methods*
3. **Data preparation**
    - Transform data into *subsets*
    - checked for *questionable, missing, or ambiguous cases*
4. **Modeling**
5. **Evaluation**
6. **Deployment**
